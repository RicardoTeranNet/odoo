The OpenERP Runbot
==================

The OpenERP Runbot (or simply runbot) is a little program monitoring and
running branches on Launchpad belonging to the different OpenERP projects,
namely `openobject-server`, `openobject-addons`, `openobject-client-web`, and
`openerp-web`. Doing so it generates a bunch of useful HTML reports.

Initialy the goal was simply to have constantly an up-to-date (i.e. using the
latest commits) running OpenERP server (with its associated web client) for
testing and demoing purpose, for both the trunk and the stable (v6) branches.

After a while, since installing some modules already performs some automatic
tests, we changed a bit the runbot to also show on a web page if those tests
passed or failed. Since then a few other changes were made (e.g. allow multiple
Launchpad teams) but the overall goal is still the same.

Installation
------------

Requirements:
- python: coverage con easy_install
- python: peewee
- python: flask
- python: flask-peewee
- sqlite
- git
- bzr
- hg
- unzip

Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf changing user by runbot's user and user group
Edit   /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf replacing:
local   all         all                               md5 by  local   all         all                               trust
or create a .pgpass file in runbot user's home folder with his postgresql password.

After, reiniciate postgres with:
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Running the runbot
------------------

The runbot is a simple command-line tool. It doesn't do much in error reporting
but its usage is straightforward. Running the following line (assuming the
executable is on your path)

  > openerp-runbot --help

will provides most of the necessary detail.

Typical usage resembles these lines:

  > openerp-runbot.py --init
  > openerp-runbot.py --run
  > openerp-runbot.py --clean

The first line creates some directories to hold the different branches and
copies of the code to be run, and some configuration files.
